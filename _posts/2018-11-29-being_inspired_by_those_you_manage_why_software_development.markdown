Over the last seventeen years I have been fortunate enough to work with incredibly talented people in Tech. I have always been in awe of a team's ability to hyper-focus on a specific issue (especially those high priority bugs that needed to be be resolved ASAP) right before a critical release.  As a former QA Engineer I would find the bugs, but didn't have the skill set to dive into the code and resolve the issue. I am sure there are many QA Engineers capable of this task, but i wasn't one of them. Eventually I became a QA Manager managing a solid group of manual testers, coaches and test automators, but also working with other disciplines as well. During the course of my day I noticed that the Developers sat in front of their monitors and didn't budge. Personally I can't sit still for fifteen minutes without getting up, so I often wondered what was it about their work that kept their attention for such long periods of time. I have to be honest, I was a little jealous. They appeared to be incredibly engaged in whatever they were doing, and watching the expression on their faces after solving a problem was fun to witness. 

In Technology, like every other industry, you see trends. Sometimes the trends don't affect you at all, other times you need to pick up on the signs presented before you and act.  These trends can be long and drawn out, or they can happen rather quickly. In my case the trend I was being exposed to was that greater emphasis was being placed on the Developer to be a better Tester, write better automated tests  for their own code (both pre-merge and post merge) and have a greater awareness of quality in general.  So, where does this leave the QA Tester or the Test Automation expert? Tough question. Some companies have transitioned into a Quality Coach, an individual that evangelizes quality and promotes best practices, but this comes with its own set of issues. 

Thinking about my future I came into work one day and borrowed a book on Swift Programming. I started around 8:15am(most people usually didn't come in until about 9:45am) and before I knew it the office was full. Did this actually happen? The best way I can describe it is that  i felt like i was being challenged by some sort of crossword puzzle I need to solve. Time flew by and I was into it. 

Perhaps someone sitting near me saw me, wondered what I was doing and wished they were as focused as I was.
