My Sinatra project was both frustrating and rewarding at the same time. The trick to keeping sane was to focus on the big picture (becoming a better developer) and less on the slow pace at which I completed the project itself.  I am now more comfortable debugging my code and feeling confident enough to break things in order to improve the overall workflow. Curiosity has come into the picture, and I might ask myself “wait , what does that file do?” and begin to explore. One cause of angst I am finding is that the more I learn the more I realize how much I don’t know, but I guess that’s common for anyone embarking on a new career. In regards to the specific project I can see that there is a method to the madness, and this project is laying the foundation for future concepts. These concepts are universal(separation of responsibilities, CRUD actions, small commits, etc). Learning HOW to start a Sinatra project was difficult, I was not aware of the out of the box Sinatra gems (Corneal) and so I built it from scratch. Good for learning, bad for time management. Overall I am pleased with the project, not so much for the end result I see on the screen, but for the fact that it demystified some of the magic behind the scenes of webpages, URLs, cookies and servers.
