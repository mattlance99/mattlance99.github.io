The day started out strong, you felt confident and alive. Your professional goals are lining up, and you are starting to formulate a plan regarding your next move. You begin to watch an instructional video within the Flatiron curriculum and out of nowhere a wave of self doubt hits you. “Wait, what was that? What does that even mean? What’s going on?!?”. You start to panic. You see the instructor effortlessly creating magical things on the screen, and you don’t think you’ll ever be able to do that . Did you make the right choice? Are you pretending to be something you are not? If I am lucky enough to be hired how long will it take before they realize I don’t know anything?

Imposter syndrome is a psychological term referring to people who doubt their accomplishments and have a belief that sooner or later they will be exposed as a fraud. People with imposter syndrome are convinced that they don’t deserve the success they have, and that they are just playing a role that easily can be replaced with someone more competent. Students can experience this when comparing themselves to the instructors/professors. The more you learn the more you realize how much you don’t know. It can cause a great deal of anxiety. 

My advice for dealing with this issue is to accept that many people experience it and to embrace it. Think of it in binary terms. Either its all in your head and you should simply move on OR its true, you don’t know anything at all. If you chose the latter, take a negative and turn it into a positive. For me that means fueling my drive and ambition. When I watch a video and see something I don’t know I simply pause the video, go back and rewatch. If I don’t get the answer from the video I look for alternative ways to learn what I didn’t know. Perfection before progression, meaning don’t move on until you got it. 

If you have feelings of self doubt than do something about it. The best piece of advise I got from my cohort lead was not to compare myself to anyone but myself, and if today’s self is better than yesterday’s self than you are on the right track.
