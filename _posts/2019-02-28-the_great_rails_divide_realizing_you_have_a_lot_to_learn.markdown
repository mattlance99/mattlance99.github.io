The Ruby on Rails project was a unique learning experience for me. I was up and running rather quick, but then seemed to hit a brick wall during nested forms.  As the project continued, the divide between what I absorbed vs. what I didn’t seem to grow. The more I learned the more I realized how little I really knew. My debugging skills definitely improved, as well as basic knowledge of GitHub and terminal commands. This doesn’t sound very exciting, but for someone who knew almost nothing about the basics of the console this felt good.  Encountering an error didn’t seem as paralyzing, I actually enjoyed working through the stack to determine the problem. I didn’t solve all issues on my own, but usually I was able to present my problem with a series of steps I took to identify the general area of the issue.  A methodical approach to debugging suites me well, I love being armed with tools that allow me to track down an issue (ex. raise params to see what’s being passed, throw in a binding.pry within a method to determine what an actual value is, etc). In addition, I do see the benefit of convention over configuration, and of course RESTful routes, which allow you to look at anyone else’s project for the very first time and immediately have a foundation of understanding. 

Two areas of growth for me…continue to learn Rails and review the basics. There’s a lot I still don’t know. I feel like I could have continued for two more months and STILL not have understood everything. Also, I forgot things too. Or maybe I was concerned about falling behind, rushed through the lab and never really learned the concepts being taught in the first place. The goal should be to retain what I previously learned and at the same time step out of my comfort zone, stop implementing the solutions I know work and try a variation of the solution for educational purposes.  

Overall, I am learning everyday, and thats my top priority.
