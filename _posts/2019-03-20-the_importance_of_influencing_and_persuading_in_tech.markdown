Engineers often focus on becoming technically excellent, perfecting the skills required to create or enhance an assigned project. The work required is often dictated to them, and the tasks are sometimes approached like a shopping list waiting to be checked off. Some engineers think their only job is to use the skills they perfected and solve the problems presented. While important, this is only part of the job of a successful engineer. 

Think about this. Instead of being removed from the planning phase of a product, you, the software engineer, become actively involved. You contribute to the design, the testing, and the implementation of how the product is rolled out. Your inclusion gives you a better understanding of the big picture, and this allows you to develop more efficiently. You can visualize the road ahead, and map out the expected pitfalls. 

Seems easy? In addition to technical skills and expertise, there are one or two other tools you’ll need in your toolkit to succeed. These are enhanced soft skills, specifically influencing and persuading. You need the ability to communicate, listen to others and at the same time read a room for facial expressions and reactions. This isn’t a game of poker, and I’m not suggesting you swindle anyone out of any money. You have to be able to express your opinions without being to abrasive, and at the same time listen to the opinions of others. Listen doesn’t mean nod your head as they speak and go about your business, it means hearing and at the same time making the other person feel valued. These acts reciprocate, and when your opinions are valued you feel fantastic about the place you work. It is rewarding experience to find that your suggestions were included in the planning and development phase of a release. Not only do you feel a sense of pride, but it also gives you better insight into the development of the product before and during the release cycle. 

Take the time to research the concepts of Influencing and Persuading. You will find that these are highly sought after skills in the tech world. Many people can become technically excellent,, but not everyone builds on soft skills. Having both technical and soft skills truly sets you apart from the rest.
