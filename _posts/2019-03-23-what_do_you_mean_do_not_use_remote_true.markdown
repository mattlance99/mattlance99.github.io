One of the first few sentences (in bold font) within the instructions of the Rails with JavaScript Portfolio Project states “Do not use remote: true in this application”. What does that mean? We never talked about it. I don’t recall seeing that within the lessons. It sounded like a warning, similar to “Danger! High Voltage”.  


Who are you to tell me not to do something I have no idea how to use even if I wanted to?  I immediately googled. OK. I get it.  More magic that makes out lives easier.  Similar to rails g scaffold. You need to learn this from the inside out before you get the answers to the test. There is a method to the madness, and this section of the curriculum was true to form. 

All of our projects are a culmination of the previous lessons, but the Rails with JavaScript Portfolio Project for me was my favorite example of this concept. You can see the progression, each lesson building upon the previous one. The serializer lessons were great, you started out with the building blocks and then learned an easier way to implement what you were taught in the previous lesson.  You need to go through the pain of starting from scratch or else you wouldn’t fully learn or appreciate how powerful the next magical tool you were given was. In the lessons for the Rails with JavaScript project you initially build out a serializer(not easy),  and then by the end you are given the gift of gem 'active_model_serializers’.

The Rails with JavaScript Portfolio Project not only mirrored the lessons within its section of the curriculum, I thought it was great that it built upon a project you yourself made a few weeks back.  You are asked to take something you once created and enhance it. The requirements for me followed the lessons perfectly. I had a good understanding of what was being asked of me, and at the same time I was able to outline the basics for each requirement. The instructions were clear, and overall the experience was both educational and fun.
