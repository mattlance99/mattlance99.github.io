Having the freedom to choose a React/Redux project with minimal restrictions is both exciting and a little intimidating. The excitement part stems from creativity, and that should originate from a subject that you enjoy. I love watching bad movies and doing my own version of Mystery Science 3000. The idea of taking what I learned from Flatiron and applying it to a subject matter I consider a hobby feels great. The scary part is not knowing where to begin and if I’m doing it right. Is this the way things should look? Is this “standard”? I decided to more or less follow a patten I felt comfortable with, and if it looked right to me than that’s the direction I went with. The site I built, ‘Mockable 80’s Movies’ allows the user to enter an 80’s movie, and then create comments about plot holes and events that would never happen in a million years. 

One thing I did realize when making the site was that I had to dig deep and pull out some old learnings from the beginning of the curriculum. The principles learned five months ago still applied today (clean code,  the single responsibility principle, etc). Its amazing how fast five months pass. Anyway, I felt lucky to use my new skills to build something I had an interest in. I enjoyed the planning phase of the site, which in my opinion is more important than actually coding. A good roadmap makes coding easier. My advise to new students, when starting a project create a flow chart of what the end result will be. Walk through the scenarios, and think about potential ways the "bad guys" can break your site. This helps you see potential problems and code accordingly. Putting in some additonal time at the beginning will save you countless hours resolving issues at the end.
