In the early 2000s the role of the Quality Assurance Engineer was pretty straight forward. Developers wrote the code and the QA Engineer/Tester was responsible for finding the bugs. As developers starting writing their own unit and integration tests, the mundane aspects of the QA Testing phase shifted from basic regression testing to exploratory testing. Developers are now expected to test their code, not simply “through it over the wall” and expect QA engineers to find and report basic mistakes. The role of the QA Engineer has shifted from mundane bug finder to quality evangelist. This encompasses a variety of responsibilities which can depend on the environment in which they work. 

It is important to understand however that Quality software is a shared responsibility and should be applied in all phases of the development life cycle. Everyone on the team, including Developers, Product Managers, and Quality Assurance engineers should be personally invested in the quality of the software that is shipped.  Quality should be considered at the very beginning of the development life cycle, in the planning phase, and should not only be applied at the end of the process by one team. Companies should focus on development and education around testing tools and infrastructure, which should also include creating a culture in which the quality of the software is a reflection of the team, not just the QA Engineer.  We want to push quality upstream, investing in planning, test design, and integrated testing. Stop thinking of quality assurance as a separate entity that is applied at the last stage of the development life cycle, right before shipping. It needs to be ever-present, with all team members invested. Quality should be considered a component of engineering excellence. Investing in the idea of pushing quality upstream using premerge testing in conjunction with solid exploratory testing results in a high quality product that ships faster.
