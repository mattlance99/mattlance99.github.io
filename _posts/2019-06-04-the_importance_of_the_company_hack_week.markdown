Some people have had the good fortune to work for a company that sponsors a hack week. During a hack week employees are encouraged to remove themselves(if possible) from their daily responsibilities and work on something, sometimes anything, that they want to. Usually there is a theme or some guidance as to what the project should relate to, but in general you have the freedom to work on something that excites you. 

In order for a hack week to be successful, the company should have a Hack Week planning committee. The committee’s main responsibility is to ensure that they provide employees with a productive environment that promotes creativity and collaboration. The week might start off with a motivating kick off meeting, followed by some optional events scheduled during the week, and then finally a closing event in which people can demo their creations. Sometimes hack week committees also have prizes for various categories (most likely to get shipped, etc). When meals or sweets are provided during scheduled hours people tend to gather and share ideas. Offering food is almost always a good idea. 

One obvious question you might ask is “why would a company allow this?”.  Truth is, the company benefits in several ways. First off, employee satisfaction. People really enjoy it, and it makes them feel good about the company they work for. Second, hack weeks provide an opportunity for people to work with others that they might not normally work with. Relationships are formed, and that is always beneficial for future projects. Third, once in a while a hack project becomes a part of the company’s product or culture. This is the greatest reward for both the employee that created it and the company that never expected it. One specific example is Spotify’s ‘Discover Weekly”, the new playlist you anxiously anticipate every Monday morning. This started out as a simple idea, was built during a hack week, and then after being beta tested made its way into the product. The end result…In its first five months, Discovery Weekly resulted in 1.7 billion streams. Not bad for something the company barely invested in.
